The project involves exploratory data analysis to understand different features of the datasets and how there are correlated to each other and are affecting thequality of the wine.
Features of the dataset includes:
RangeIndex: 1599 entries, 0 to 1598
Data columns (total 12 columns):
 #   Column                Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------                --------------  -----  
 0   fixed acidity         1599 non-null   float64
 1   volatile acidity      1599 non-null   float64
 2   citric acid           1599 non-null   float64
 3   residual sugar        1599 non-null   float64
 4   chlorides             1599 non-null   float64
 5   free sulfur dioxide   1599 non-null   float64
 6   total sulfur dioxide  1599 non-null   float64
 7   density               1599 non-null   float64
 8   pH                    1599 non-null   float64
 9   sulphates             1599 non-null   float64
 10  alcohol               1599 non-null   float64
 11  quality               1599 non-null   int64  
dtypes: float64(11), int64(1)

We have assumed wine quality of value above 7 as good quality and based on the feature selection we will try to use different algorithms to define models to try to predict the wine quality.
