The project involves exploratory data analysis to understand different features of the datasets and how there are correlated to each other and are affecting thequality of the wine.
Features of the dataset includes:
RangeIndex: 1599 entries, 0 to 1598
Data columns (total 12 columns):  
 0   fixed acidity         
 1   volatile acidity      
 2   citric acid           
 3   residual sugar        
 4   chlorides             
 5   free sulfur dioxide   
 6   total sulfur dioxide  
 7   density               
 8   pH                    
 9   sulphates             
 10  alcohol               
 11  quality               

We have assumed wine quality of value above 7 as good quality and based on the feature selection we will try to use different algorithms to define models to try to predict the wine quality.
