Self-Projects
The directories contain exploratory machine learning project. 

The aim of these projects is to perform exploratory:
Data analysis, 
Filling missing data, 
Feature engineering, 
Computing feature importance 
Implementing machine learning algorithms to build model
to perform training and prediction on given datasets downloaded from kaggle.

Steps included in this projects:
    Importing Lib
    Loading Data
    Understanding Data
    Missing Values
    Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
    Feature Selection
    Train_test_split/Preparing Data for Modelling
    Applying different models
    Choosing right model
