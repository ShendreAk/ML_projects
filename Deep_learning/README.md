About the Data

The daraset used for this project is a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

The dataset is a modified version of the original dataset to perform some extra feature engineering. LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Our Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we aim to build a deep learning model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

We have performed the following tasks:
1). Exploratory data analysis
2). Filling missing values
3). Feature engineering
4). Model building 
5). Prediction and accuracy estimation.
